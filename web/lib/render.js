// COPIED from worker/src/render.js by tools/sync_web.mjs - do not edit here.
// The preview and the ticket must come from one implementation, not two.
// Text -> printer lines. The only place a ticket's look is decided.
//
// Constraint 7 of the brief: no text rendering on the machine, ever. The
// Worker produces the packed lines and the machine only relays bytes. That
// survived the move from BLE to USB unchanged, and it is the reason the switch
// was a week of work rather than a rewrite: a Raspberry Pi could rasterise
// text perfectly well, and letting it would put the look of the ticket on a
// box in the flat instead of in this file.
//
// TWO LAYOUTS, AND WHY BOTH SURVIVE
//
// The geometry comes from profiles.js, and so does the choice of layout:
//
//   framed  title, rules, reference and date, with margins that read as
//           margins. What both printers draw since 3 September.
//   bare    message and signature, nothing else. What the MXW01 drew from 30
//           August to 3 September, and still the right answer at volume.
//
// The choice is arithmetic, not taste. The furniture costs about 13 mm a
// ticket whatever the paper: on a 72 mm strip that is a header, and on a 30 mm
// one it is 40% of the ticket. THAT is what removed it here for a month - this
// deployment's queue passed a thousand messages and a four-metre roll holds
// 132 tickets - and it is why `bare` is still here rather than deleted. A
// printer somebody points a public link at wants it; a printer on a desk
// printing what friends send does not, and comes out looking like a mistake
// without a rule at each end.
