// The live preview: your words, drawn with the printer's own atlas.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
//
// The page could have shown what you type in a web font and rendered the real
// ticket only after you pressed the button. That is one more typeface to pick,
// and it is a typeface that LIES: it wraps at a different column, it has
// characters the print head does not, and the first time somebody's careful
// layout comes out mangled they have no way of knowing why.
//
// So there is no second typeface. The textarea on top of this canvas is
// transparent, and the only rendering of anybody's words on this page is the
// one the print head would lay down: same atlas, same blitter, same dots
// across, same one bit deep. What you see is the ticket.
//
// It follows that changing the ticket font changes the page, which is the
// point. `python tools/build_font.py --preset typewriter` and this file needs
// no edit: it never names a font, a size or a column count, it asks the atlas.
//
// The rendering itself lives in web/ticket.js, with the social card's, because
// drawing a ticket for a person has a rule that must not be forgotten and this
// file forgot it once. app.js owns the form, the submit and the printing
// animation; this file only draws, and the two never touch the same element.
