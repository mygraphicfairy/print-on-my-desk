// Umami, proxied through this origin.
//
// Two problems the standard tag has in production, and the proxy fixes both:
//
//   Blockers. uBlock, AdGuard and Brave filter umami.is by name, so a real
//   share of visitors is never counted and nothing looks broken.
//
//   Two hosts. The script LOADS from cloud.umami.is but SENDS to
//   gateway.umami.is. Anything that allows only the first, a CSP among them,
//   yields a dashboard at zero while the script loads perfectly.
//
// Served from /m, with no "umami" or "script.js" anywhere in the path, both
// requests become same-origin. The house pattern does this in PHP on OVH; here
// the Worker is already the edge, so it does it directly.
//
// The two things the gateway cannot work out for itself once we are in the
// middle are the visitor's address and their user agent, so both are passed
// on: without them every visit geolocates to the Worker and reads as one
// person. The address is forwarded, never stored; this Worker keeps only
// salted hashes of its own (see hashIp in index.js).
//
// the owner's instance is self-hosted on Vercel, which overwrites x-forwarded-for
// with the caller's address - this Worker's. The visitor's address therefore
// also travels in x-visitor-ip, the header the instance is configured to
// trust (CLIENT_IP_HEADER). Umami Cloud ignores it, so it costs nothing there.
