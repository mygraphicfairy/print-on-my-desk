 * Atomically hands one job to one device, without reading the queue.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT, so it is worth stating plainly.
 *
 * It used to be one statement: a LEFT JOIN onto `supporters` and
 * `ORDER BY (s.job_id IS NOT NULL) DESC, j.created_at ASC`. That reads
 * correctly and costs everything. No index can satisfy an ORDER BY over a
 * computed expression, so SQLite walked EVERY approved job, joined each one,
 * and sorted the lot into a temporary B-tree - to hand back a single row.
 * Measured on 1 September against a queue of twenty thousand: the old form
 * takes 2.8 ms per claim and the two below take 0.1 ms, and the gap is not a
 * constant. It is the length of the queue.
 *
 * Four thousand tickets printed out of a five thousand deep queue is four
 * thousand claims, each reading the whole queue: twenty million rows, on a
 * free tier that allows five. That is the other half of what the expiry sweep
 * started, and it is the half that gets worse every time somebody posts.
 *
 * So the priority is expressed as two statements instead of one sort:
 *
 *   1. anything a supporter paid for - bounded by the supporters table, which
 *      holds one row per a tip jar payment and will not reach four figures;
 *   2. otherwise the oldest approved job, which idx_jobs_queue answers
 *      directly, one row read, whatever the queue is doing.
 *
 * Each statement is still a single atomic UPDATE ... WHERE id = (SELECT ...),
 * so two devices polling at once cannot be handed the same row. They are not
 * atomic WITH EACH OTHER, and they do not need to be: the worst interleaving
 * hands one device a thank-you and the other an ordinary message, which is the
 * outcome either order would have produced anyway.

// twelve payments are not in it, which is the exact cost this rewrite was for.
