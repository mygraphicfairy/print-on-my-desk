// The two printers, and everything that differs between them.
//
// Until 31 August there was one printer and its geometry was three constants
// scattered through bitmap.js and render.js. The AURES TRP 100 III is wider,
// coarser and reached over USB instead of BLE, and none of those numbers hold:
// 512 dots instead of 384, 0.141 mm per dot instead of 0.125, no keepalive, no
// CRC echo. Rather than edit the constants and lose the small printer, both
// live here and the device says which one it is.
//
// WHY THE SMALL PRINTER STAYS
//
// The MXW01 work is the part of this project worth publishing: a protocol
// reverse-engineered from captures, with three upstream implementations proved
// wrong on four points (docs/09-protocol.md). It is paused, not deleted. Every
// path it needs - the 384-wide canvas, its own layout, firmware/ - still runs
// and is still tested, so the day it is released it is released working.
//
// HOW A PROFILE IS CHOSEN
//
// /api/machine/next?profile=<id>. Absent means mxw01, because the Pico's
// firmware was written before this field existed and must keep working
// untouched - that is the whole point of the paragraph above.

 * (512 dots), paper 79.5 +/- 0.5 mm. It is NOT 576 dots, which is what most

 *
 * CONFIRMED BY THE MACHINE, 31 August. Its self-test prints "42 Char/Line",
 * and ESC/POS font A is 12 dots wide: 42 columns needs 504 dots and rules out
 * 43. A 576-dot printer would have said 48. So the width below is measured,
 * not read. Firmware Ver 5.16AR, emulation ESC/POS.
 *
 * 7.0866 dots/mm rather than 8 has a consequence worth stating: the same
 * bitmap comes out 13% larger. The font atlas is unchanged and the letters
 * grow from 1.50 to 1.69 mm wide, which is why no atlas was rebuilt.
