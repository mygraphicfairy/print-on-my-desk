// Drawing a ticket for a PERSON, and the two ways it has already gone wrong.

// The MXW01 renders pre-rotated, because its head is mounted upside down. That
// is correct for the print head and wrong for eyes, and undoing it used to be
// a line you had to remember in every place that drew a ticket. Two places out
// of three forgot, and neither author could see it, because both were written
// while the page previewed the TRP 100 III - a profile with no rotation at all.
//
// So: one door (web/ticket.js), and these tests on it.
